Project Overview:

The purpose of the project was to impliment a binary full adder. That involved several steps that were done using different software and hardware. A schematic design was done in Intel Quartus Prime IDE, then the design was simulated in ModelSim. Then, the correctness of the design was tested with DEO-Nano and implimented with physical hardware pieces (wires, logical gates etc.)
